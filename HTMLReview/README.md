# HTMLReview
This project folder, html-review, serves as a portfolio showcase of my front-end web development skills. Within this directory, youâ€™ll find a series of responsive, user-centred HTML pages that demonstrate my ability to build modern web interfaces using semantic HTML5, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript.

I am using this directory as a space to document and demonstrate my growing expertise in web development. It reflects my ability to create structured, maintainable codebases while implementing interactive features and thoughtful design choices. This serves as a transparent window into both my technical capabilities and my dedication to quality user experience.
